# The Durham Poems

[*The Durham Poems*](https://thecodeofthings.com/poems/the-durham-poems/) are a collection of poems concerning William Denton's childhood and youth, specifically the years 1823 to 1842, in the county of Durham, UK. William Denton was born in Darlington and spent his early working life in Darlington and Shildon, working a number of jobs and apprenticeships, first as a currier when he was eleven and from the age of fourteen as a machinist in Timothy Hackworth's workshop.

It was also during this period that Denton proselytised on a range of topics including temperance and religion. He kept drafts of these speeches in his early journals along with his mathematics notes for his machinist apprenticeship.

*The Durham Poems* is part of [a series of print and electronic poems on William Denton (1823-1883)](https://thecodeofthings.com).
